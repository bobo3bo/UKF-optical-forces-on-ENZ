# Activity on the project

## project log:

### 28th of June
First (wrong) results in the calculations of the force from Maxwell's stress tensor due to the simulation space being too small.  
![Fxyz vs box size](./activity/pictures/20degmesh5nmexport700nmmetlabmesh5nm500.03.FxyzRGB.png)  
Total force (Fx-red, Fy-green, Fz-blue) vs. sidelength of the cube on whose surfaces the MST and force is calculated. With bigger cubes the force should converge in value, while at small sizes there should be numerical artifacts.

### 20th of June
I gave a presentation about the work at [Laboratory for optics and optical thin films](https://www.irb.hr/eng/Divisions/Division-of-Materials-Physics/Laboratory-for-optics-and-optical-thin-films) on 'Electric field assisted dissolution of metals' in the project [REPTOSNANODOPS](https://sites.google.com/view/reptosnanodops)

### 13th of June
First simulations look ok. The electric field **E** (and associated displacement field **D**) flowing around an subwavelength ENZ slab look like the flow of water aroung an object (ENZ slab is at 45 degrees).

### 3rd of June
I've come to London to start the project!
