### December
results of the project

### November
<!-- foo bar -->*2D

### October
<!-- *torque, tensor algebra -->

### September
<!-- *continue checking missmatch and source of difference -->

The main idea of this project, as well as the methodology used, were presented on the [iPlasmaNano 2019 conferance](http://www.iplasmanano2019.com/) in the form of a poster.

### August
<!-- *continue checking missmatch and source of difference -->

### July
<!-- *problems with calculations, used scatt fields, checked empty space (meshing, simulation volume, diff freq). Checking unwanted Ez component in PW, addPW in Matlab, checking mesh
missmatch theory and numerical -->



### 28th of June
First (wrong) results in the calculations of the force from Maxwell's stress tensor due to the simulation space being too small.

Total force (Fx-red, Fy-green, Fz-blue) [N] vs. sidelength [nm] of the cube on whose surfaces the MST and force is calculated. With bigger cubes the force should converge in value, while at small sizes there should be numerical artifacts.

### 20th of June
I gave a presentation about the work at [Laboratory for optics and optical thin films](https://www.irb.hr/eng/Divisions/Division-of-Materials-Physics/Laboratory-for-optics-and-optical-thin-films) on 'Electric field assisted dissolution of metals' in the project [REPTOSNANODOPS](https://sites.google.com/view/reptosnanodops)

### 13th of June
First simulations look ok. The electric field **E** (and associated displacement field **D**) flowing around an subwavelength ENZ slab look like the flow of water aroung an object (ENZ slab is at 45 degrees).

### 3rd of June
I've come to London to start the project!
